## üóëÔ∏è Training Samples to Discard

### Sample 1: ID #481

**Question:** How many calories are in a slice of pepperoni and cheese pizza?

**Crowd Majority:** `unanswerable`

**Reason for discard:** The question asks for information (calorie count) that is not visually present in an image and requires external knowledge to answer.

### Sample 2: ID #563

**Question:** Where do you think I could get a power cord? 

**Crowd Majority:** `unanswerable`

**Reason for discard:** The question asks for external information (where to buy an item) rather than asking about the visual content of the image itself.

### Sample 3: ID #426

**Question:** I know but how long do I leave it in the oven for? Now how long is the cooking time?

**Crowd Majority:** `unanswerable`

### Sample 4: ID #479

**Question:** Can you tell me what is on the other side of this box? In the photo I just sent you. Thank you.

**Crowd Majority:** `unanswerable`

**Reason for discard:** The question asks about something that is not visible in the image (the other side of the box), and therefore cannot be answered from the visual content provided.

### Sample 5: ID #289

**Question:** What color is...

### Sample 6: ID #598

**Question:** Where did this come from?

**Crowd Majority:** `unanswerable`

**Reason for discard:** The question is ambiguous. 'This' is an unclear pronoun and 'come from' could have multiple interpretations (e.g., sender, manufacturer, location) that may or may not be answerable from an image.

### Sample 7: ID #504

**Question:** This image does not show who the mail is for. It appears to be taken too close up on one part of the envelope without text.

**Crowd Majority:** `clockwise`

**Reason for discard:** This is a statement or comment about the image, not a question asking for visual information.

### Sample 8: ID #507

**Question:** Should I eat this for me tea?

**Crowd Majority:** `unanswerable`

**Reason for discard:** The question asks for a subjective opinion or advice ('Should I...') rather than an objective description of the visual content. Answering it requires external knowledge and personal context, not just visual analysis.

### Sample 9: ID #458

**Question:** Oh so do I leave it in for twelve months then do I?

**Crowd Majority:** `unanswerable`

**Reason for discard:** The question begins with 'Oh so...', which indicates it is a follow-up question that requires context from a previous conversation to be understood. It is not a standalone query.

### Sample 2: ID #464

**Question:** Is this picture better?

**Question:** Do you think my wife's decorating is any good or should I kick her out?
